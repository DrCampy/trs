<p style="font-weight: bold">TRS is a cross-platform robot development and simulation environment that can be installed in five minutes and that allows students to write control, navigation, vision or manipulation algorithms in a hundred lines of Matlab or Python code. The tutorial relies on the V-REP robot simulator, and on the Matlab Robotics Toolbox (RTB). The key feature of this combination is its ease of use &ndash; both tools are trivial to install.
</p>

        <p>Because working with hardware is time-consuming, many Master-level and PhD-level robotics courses leave hardware issues aside, to give the students time to study theoretical concepts and information-processing algorithms. Unfortunately, hardware-free courses often come with no hands-on exercises, which impedes learning. This tutorial discusses one solution to this problem: allowing students to gain practical experience in a simulated environment. Open-source simulators have existed for a long time, but their limited ease-of-use made them impractical for teaching. Ease of use is crucial in teaching: The software must be robust, multi-platform, and its installation has to be trivial. <a href="http://www.coppeliarobotics.com">V-REP</a>, the simulator on which this tutorial is based, can be installed on 
Linux, OSX and Windows simply by uncompressing zip archive.</p>

<p>Software development is another major challenge in robot development. This tutorial is based on the <a href="http://petercorke.com/Robotics_Toolbox.html">Robotics Toolbox for MATLAB</a> (RTB), a library of robot-oriented software building blocks. Its Matlab implementation makes it accessible to branches of engineering where fluency in C++ is not expected.</p>

<p>The aim of this tutorial is to present an environment, based on V-REP and RTB, that allows students to control a robot from Matlab. The environment consists of a set of Matlab scripts, and a V-REP file modeling a mobile robot and a building floor. Running a single Matlab command establishes a connection between Matlab and V-REP. The user is then able to recover sensor data (images, scans, odometry), process those data, and send commands to the robot's actuators. The robot's sensors and actuators are accessed via Matlab functions:</p>

<p><tt>vrep.simxSetJointTargetVelocity(id, wheel1, 10);</tt></p>

<p>An understanding of the simulator itself is not required, as all the programming is done through the Matlab interface.</p>

  <p>The behavior of the youBot shown in this video is coded in Matlab in 500 lines of code. The youBot explores and maps its environment, and it detects and marks rounded baskets. The code runs in quasi-realtime on a standard laptop.

<p>TRS provides a recipe for organizing a Master-level robotics project. The project consists in using a mobile robot to pickup groceries from a table and move them to different baskets distributed across a house. The project involves control, navigation, mapping, vision and manipulation. The recipe is composed of
<ul>
<li>a page that explains how to <a href="setup.html">setup</a> a laptop to work on the project,</li>
<li>a page that presents the <a href="project.html">project definition</a>: objectives, milestones, a description of the robot and the documentation of the Matlab functions that access the robot's sensors and actuators,</li>
<li>a Matlab script that illustrates access the robot's sensors and actuators</li>
<li>a V-REP model of a building floor, and a few Matlab scripts that make programming easier.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>TRS is intended primarily for teachers, but students are welcome to use it for personal projects.</p>

<p>All of the TRS material (code and documentation) are published under open licenses (GPL or CC), allowing anyone to copy, improve, and hopefully contribute back, to provide robotics students with an excellent learning experience.</p>
